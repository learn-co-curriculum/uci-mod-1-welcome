## Introduction

Welcome! This course is designed to provide you with the tools to build your own
static websites using HTML and CSS.

First, we will introduce the Learn platform, how lesson content is delivered and
how to use the command line. This will be necessary for completing the test-driven content of the course.

After this, we will explore HTML and CSS in depth, followed by a final project
and assessment. To get started, click the "I'm Done" button and proceed to the
